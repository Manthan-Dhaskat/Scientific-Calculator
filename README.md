## 🧭 Project Overview

This web-based calculator is designed to deliver the power of advanced mathematics tools through a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing interface.

### Key Functional Areas

#### 🧮 **Basic Calculator**
- Supports arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.  
- Factorials, powers, and constants like π and e.  
- **DEG/RAD toggle** for trigonometric operations.  
- Real-time calculations with dynamic error handling.  
- Persistent calculation history using `localStorage`.  
- Error message display appears only when needed — hidden otherwise.

---

#### 🧩 **Matrix Operations**
- Define matrix size dynamically (rows × columns).  
- Ghost-zero placeholders for easy data entry.  
- Keyboard navigation (Tab / Enter / Arrows).  
- Includes:
  - Determinant  
  - Inverse  
  - Transpose  
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication  
- Results displayed in styled matrix grid format.

---

#### 🧭 **Vector Calculations**
- Horizontal vector input with live length-based generation.  
- Supports:
  - Magnitude and Unit Vector  
  - Addition, Subtraction  
  - Dot Product, Cross Product (3D)  
  - Angle Between Vectors  
  - Projection of A onto B  

---

#### ⚛️ **Complex Number Operations**
- Compact inline input layout (`A = [real] + [imag] i`).  
- Performs:
  - Conjugate, Magnitude, Argument  
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
  - Polar ↔ Rectangular Conversion  
- Automatically formats results as `a + bi` or `a - bi`.

---

#### 📊 **Statistics Toolkit**
- Single text area for comma/space/newline-separated data.  
- Choose **Sample** or **Population** mode for variance & std. deviation.  
- Dedicated operation buttons:
  - Mean, Median, Mode  
  - Range, Variance, Std. Dev  
  - Sum, Count, Minimum, Maximum  
- Clean, labeled result block that updates instantly.  
- Auto-clears when closed to prevent data clutter.

---

## 🎨 User Interface Design
- Elegant glassmorphic theme with consistent spacing and typography.  
- Auto-resizing modals for large data entry.  
- Responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **Dark / Light Theme toggle** (persistent across sessions).  
- Subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations for modern feel.  
- Optimized for readability and usability.
